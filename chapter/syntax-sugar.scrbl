@section{Preface: What's wrong with Racketish?}
@ch9-tech{Exprs-lang v9} is a good start at a core language.
@;@ch10-tech{Racketish-core} is a good start at a core language.
You could start building standard libraries and get to work.
But it's missing a handful of nice features.
Most languages support various complex data literals, such as literals for
lists, array, or other structured data.
They also support features you cannot encode as functions, like short-circuiting
boolean operations @racket[and] and @racket[or].

These get elaborated very early.
In Racket, these are mostly implemented as @emph{macros}, a user-defined
function that transformer source syntax.
We'll design a compiler pass that isn't quite a macro system, but should
give you an idea of how a macro system works, and give you the ability to add
new syntactic sugar to the language.

Below, we define @deftech{Racketish-Surface}.

@bettergrammar*[
racketish-surface
]

We add two special syntaxes, @racketish-surface[(quote s-expr)] for quoted
lists, and @racketish-surface[(vector value ...)] for vector literals.
Note that our language does not have symbols, so our @racketish-surface[s-expr]
differs from Racket's.
The only thing to know is that this takes an arbitrary number of arguments.

We also add two reader notations to the surface language.
@object-code{'s-expr} is a reader macro in Racket and is implicitly elaborated
to @racketish-surface[(quote s-expr)].
@object-code{#(value ...)} is the notation for vector literals, and is equivalent to
@racketish-surface[(vector 'value ...)], but not syntactically identical in the same way
@object-code{'s-expr} and @racketish-surface[(quote s-expr)] are.

Because Racket's reader supports them, we do not have to do much to
add them!
We avoid implementing a parser once more (huzzah!).
This is one interesting feature of @deftech{bootstrapping}---defining a language
in itself.
When the meta and object languages share features, merely using a compiler that
already implements the feature implements the feature.
@margin-note{Parsing is often described as a solved problem, but it is not, and
is easy to get wrong, and doing a bad job can
@hyperlink["https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags"]{summon
the dark gods to our realm}.
We do not want to summon dark gods, so we worked directly with data in the host
language, and it was fine.
}

You can see the two are equivalent in Racket by typing the following in
to the REPL or in the interactions frame in DrRacket:
@codeblock{
'(1 2 3)

(quote (1 2 3))

#(1 2 3)

(vector 1 2 3)
}

@margin-note{I can't typeset these examples using my normal REPL typesetting
feature since Racket implicitly renders them identically.}

Using @racket[match] on this notation requires a little care, since our program
is itself a quoted datum in Racket, and @racket[match] treats them slightly
differently.
@codeblock{
(match '(quote (1 2 3))
  [`(quote ,es) es])

(match ''(1 2 3)
  [`(quote ,es) es])

(match '#(1 2 3)
  [`#(,es ...) es])

(match '#(1 2 3)
  [(vector es ...) es])

;; Fails to match
(match '#(1 2 3)
  [`(vector ,es ...) es])
}

We also introduce a new form for applying macros, and add a few macros.
We also make procedure calls implicit; essentially, anything that looks
like an application form is either a macro application, or, is implicitly a
procedure call.

@section{Implementing Syntactic Sugar}
@;Macros can often introduce new variable binding, so it's still important to have
@;some mechanism for handling fresh variables.
@;Before we expand, we once more @racket[uniquify].
@;
@;Below we define @deftech{Racketish-Unique}, updating it to include the
@;new forms and macros.
@;We typeset changes with respect to @tech{Racketish-Surface}.
@;
@;@bettergrammar*-ndiff[
@;(racketish-surface racketish-unique)
@;]
@;
@;@nested[#:style 'inset
@;@defproc[(uniquify [p racketish-surface?]) racketish-unique?]{
@;Resolves all @ch3-tech{lexical identifiers} into unique @ch2-tech{abstract
@;locations}.}]

Macro expansion is the first step.
Ideally, this is designed to be extensible, so we can add new macros at will, or
even allow the user to define macros.

Our target language is @ch9-tech{Exprs-lang v9}

@bettergrammar*-ndiff[
#:labels ("Diff vs Source")
(racketish-surface exprs-lang-v9)
]

All macros are elaborated to existing features.
We also elaborate implicit procedure call into explicit
@object-code{call}.

Notice that the vector literal notation embeds an actual Racket vector in our
AST.
@examples[#:eval sb
(vector-ref (second '(module #(1 2 3))) 0)
]
This vector is required to only contain values from @tech{Racketish-Surface}.

And the quoted literal notation actually expands to the symbol @code{quote},
although it always gets printed as a tick:
@examples[#:eval sb
'(module '(#t #f))
(first (second '(module '(#t #f))))
]

The transformations we want to define are given below:
@itemlist[
@item{@object-code{(and v ...)}
@racketblock[
`(and) _=> #t
`(and ,e) _=> e
`(and ,e ,es ...) _=> `(if ,e (and ,es ...) #f)
]

When @object-code{and} is given no arguments, we expand to #t, since #t is the
multiplicative identity element on booleans (like 1 is for integers and
multiplication).
When given a single argument, we return it, since Racket is falsey.
Otherwise, we elaborate to branch on the first argument, and recursively expand
@object-code{and} applied to the rest of its arguments.
}
@item{@object-code{(or v ...)}
@racketblock[
`(or) _=> #f
`(or ,e) _=> e
`(or ,e ,es ...) _=> `(let ([,tmp ,e]) (if ,tmp ,tmp (or ,es ...)))
]

When @object-code{or} is given no arguments, we expand to #f, since #f is the
additive identity element on booleans (like 0 is for integers and addition).
When given a single argument, we return it, since Racket is falsey.
Otherwise, we bind the first argument to a fresh auxiliary variable, return it
if it's true, and otherwise return the @object-code{or} of the rest of the
arguments.

Notice that since we introduce an auxiliary variable we could accidentally
capture any use of a free variable in @object-code{es ...}, just like any
compiler pass that introduces auxiliary variables.
We use @racket[fresh] as normal, since our representation of @ch2-tech{abstract
locations} are valid names.
}
@item{@object-code{(vector e ...)} and @object-code{#(e ...)}
@racketblock[
`(vector ,es ...)
_=>
`(let ([,tmp (make-vector ,(length es))])
   (begin
     (vector-set! ,tmp 0 ,(list-ref es 0))
     ...
     (vector-set! ,tmp ,(sub1 (length es)) ,(list-ref es (sub1 (length es))))
     tmp))
]
}
@item{@object-code{(quote s-expr)}
@racketblock[
`(quote ,v) _=> v
`(quote (,s-expr ,s-exprs ...))
_=>
`(cons (quote ,s-expr) (quote (,s-exprs ...)))
]
}
@item{@object-code{(begin e ...)}
@racketblock[
`(begin) _=> '(void)
`(begin ,e) _=> e
`(begin ,e ,es ...)
_=>
`(let ([,tmp ,e])
   (if (error? ,tmp)
       ,tmp
       `(begin ,es ...)))
]

We add a surface-level begin form that handles propagating errors correctly.
This is essentially an implementation of @tt{do} for the monad.
}
]

These rewrites are essentially @racket[syntax-case] macros, recursive
pattern-based macros that can perform computation at compile time.

Notice that each macro can generate more uses of macros.
As a result, the recursive structure of this elaborate pass is going to be
slightly different from other passes.

@;There are (at least) two ways to design the @racket[expand-macros] function:
@;either as a compiler (easy way), or as a macro expander (hard way).
@;As a compiler, you design the function as you have designed all your other
@;compiler transformations, more or less.
@;
@;As a macro expander, your should have an environment of macro identifiers bound
@;to @deftech{macro transformers}---functions from syntax to syntax, which the
@;compiler will execute.
@;The @tech{macro transformer} receives the syntax of the expression that invoked
@;it, as an s-expression, and should return a new s-expression.
@;To implement this, you need to add a notion of symbols to the language of your
@;macro transformers, and an interpreter to run macro transformers at
@;compile-time.
@;The symbols do not need to remain in the language after macro-expansion, since
@;they will only be used by the macro-expander.
